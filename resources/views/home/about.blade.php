                <h1>What's This All About</h1>
                <p>What is the purpose of a gendered single-occupancy bathroom? If only one person is in there at a time, what does it matter what their gender is? Isn't it absurd to see people waiting in line <em>right next</em> to an open bathroom?</p>
                <p>There is no purpose. Gendered single-occupancy bathrooms are a scourge to society. In fact, they've recently been outlawed in <a href="http://www.lgbtqnation.com/2015/12/all-new-york-city-single-occupancy-bathrooms-now-required-to-be-gender-neutral/">New York City</a>.</p>
                <h3>The Danger to Transgender and Gender Non-Conforming People</h3>
                <p>Transgender and gender non-conforming people are often unsafe in typical gendered restrooms. We are frequently victims of harassment and sexual assault, even as political campaigns against us claim <em>we</em> are endangering everyone else.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    A 2013 survey of nearly 500 Massachusetts transgender adults found that 65 percent had experienced discrimination based on their gender identity in public settings during the previous 12 months. Just over half (55 percent) of those reporting such discrimination also reported having experienced physical symptoms of stress during the past 30 days, while only 37 percent of respondents who had not reported experiences of discrimination had such symptoms.

                <h3>We Just Want To Pee!</h3>
                <p>I sure wish Minneapolis would pass a law like NYC, but I'm not holding my breath. In the meantime, we can reach out to local businesses that have gendered single-occupancy bathrooms and ask them to change.</p>
                <p>In many cases, it should be as easy as changing the signage. A small change for a business owner - with a real health and safety benefit for the transgender community.</p>
                <h3>TAKE ACTION!</h3>
                <p>That's what this website is for. You, (yes YOU) can flag local businesses that have gendered single-occupancy restrooms. You can send an email to businesses other people have flagged.</p>
